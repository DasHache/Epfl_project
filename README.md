# Epfl_project

31.12.2021
had found the idea of creating a program for circuits.

02.01.2022
created a version with a simple GR cicruit. had some difficulties with spyder so had to run the prog from the terminal. trying to figure out how to work with github to follow my work. will try to optimise the code later today and tomorrow. 

optimised a bit the code, renamed some variables, figured out the stuff with the git and spyder so now it works
